OpenMRS Pharmacy module project

Overview
The pharmacy module is being developed in order to have a module which will help HF to reduce patient
waiting times for ARV drug pickups, reduce the workload of overburdened pharmacy staff, and improve 
quality of data related to ARV stock management (ie MMIA) and patient status (ie accurately report LTF 
in the HIV monthly report) in larger urban HFs.
The module will also report the current ARV inventory for stock management (the info on initial stock, 
inflows, outflows, expirations and current inventory comes from the pharmacy stock cards).
